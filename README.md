# ◆ Ghost Agent

**Agentic Intermediary for Social Messaging**

Ghost Agent is an AI-powered communication hub that sits between you and your social messaging platforms (WhatsApp & Facebook). It acts as an intelligent intermediary — monitoring incoming messages, drafting context-aware replies using AI, and letting you review or override responses before they're sent.

## What It Does

- **Secure Bridge** — Connect your WhatsApp or Facebook account via QR code authentication
- **Chat Interface** — Direct messaging console with automatic AI handoff for drafting replies
- **Activity Monitor** — Real-time stream of incoming messages across platforms with AI-drafted responses
- **Ghost Mode** — The AI handles routine conversations on your behalf while you stay in control of important ones

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js 16** (App Router + Turbopack)
- **React 19** with TypeScript
- **Framer Motion** for animations
- **Brutalist / minimalist UI** — monochrome palette, monospaced type, sharp borders
